3D printed fence
=========
As part of my `Advanced Prototyping` minor programme from the faculty of Architecture and of Industrial Design (Delft University of Technology), I did quite a bit of 3D-modeling. This particular 3D-model was to be showcased / embedded on my website, the reason I made this repository.    
It was also 3D-printed and laser cut..  

Voronoi
------
I used the fascinating [**Voronoi**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) algorithm to extrude the pattern in the fence, using the `Grasshopper` plugin for `Rhinoceros`. It looks similar to how a bunch of cells in, for example, plants look.
